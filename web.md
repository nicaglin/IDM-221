#Website Inspiration

##[R/M Design School](http://school.readymag.com/)

1. Really like the visual background where the colors pop out. It is very eye catching. 
2. Also enjoy the way the scrolling works on the page. Very smooth and it is clear when different topics are being presented when going through the lessons.
3. I do not like the placement of the about and subscribe hyperlinks on the main page, however I do understand that the main focus of the website is to provide design lessens and not necessarily inform others to subscribe.

1. Again enjoy the scolling in the fact that each topic is clearly defined. 
2. Like the font. It matches with the branding of the site, such as the picture that was drawn in the beginning with the continuous red line. 
3. Also like that the left side includes how many sections are in the page and where the current page stands in the rest of the layout. 
4. Do not like the navigation as much. This is in terms of when at the bottom of the pages, there's arrows for the adjacent pages. Also do not like the fact that there is a menu on the main navigation. The extra pages could just be included without the extra menu section.

1. Like the simplivity and the color scheme of it. 
2. Enjoy the interactivity of the books and how they react when scrolling over them. 
3. Do not like how the website does not pull in viewers. There is not as much that makes it memorable.
