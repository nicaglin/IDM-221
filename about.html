	<!-- bio is from the ci.md file -->
		<p>Born in Toledo, Ohio, Veronica Lin grew up with many passions. They were very diverse from sports such as basketball to music such as playing the violin. Her love for numbers and more analytical aspects came from her parents, who worked in the mathematics and accounting field. Even though there is a significant age gap between Veronica and her older brother, they still remain close and very supportive of each other.</p>

		<p>One of the passions that she really fostered was her love of service. Even in elementary school Veronica had a big heart for helping others. She frequently aided a student with cerebral palsy and went on to become a peer leader to help classmates resolve difficult conflict. All throughout high school she was involved with an organization called Key Club. During her third year, she served as the Lieutenant Governor of Division 3 of Michigan.</p>

		<p>Another large part of Veronicaâ€™s identity was formed during her years at a summer conference called Taiwanese American Foundation. There Veronica learned more about her culture, connected with many individuals from all over the country, and continued to learn and grow as an individual. There were many seminars and discussions. As short as the conference was, many life long bonds were formed and it was always a week out of the 52 of the year that she really looked forward to.</p>

		<p>Currently Veronica is a student at Drexel University. She loves pugs and enjoys eating watermelon. In her spare time, she is slowly discovering more of the city of Philadelphia. Veronica enjoys reading and crushing her opponents in a game of Monopoly Deal. She enjoys learning about other individuals and discovering the many things that they have to offer. Veronica hopes to make a difference on the world one day even as small as it could be.</p>
